-- Set — league play schema (slice 3, first milestone)
--
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor once the project exists. It creates the
-- tables + row-level-security (RLS) rules so that:
--   * players can only read their own records and their leagues' leaderboards,
--   * the daily board's SOLUTION is never readable by any client (only the
--     server-side Edge Function can see it), per the anti-cheat design.
--
-- Board generation and leaderboard math are NOT in here on purpose — they reuse
-- the pure TypeScript modules (generateBoard, deriveStats) so there is one
-- source of truth. See supabase/functions/ (Edge Function) and the app client.
--
-- Order: all tables first (so policies can reference each other), then the
-- policies, then the join-by-code function.

-- Tables
-- ===========================================================================

-- profiles: one row per signed-in user, holds the display name shown on boards.
create table if not exists profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  display_name text not null check (char_length(display_name) between 1 and 40),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- leagues: the config you set up (name, timezone, game mode, join code).
create table if not exists leagues (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text not null,
  timezone text not null,                       -- IANA tz, e.g. 'Asia/Singapore'
  mode text not null check (mode in ('A', 'B', 'C')),
  join_code text not null unique,               -- players use this to join
  penalty_base_ms int not null default 5000,    -- Mode C: base penalty (doubles each false done)
  created_by uuid references auth.users (id),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- memberships: who belongs to which league.
create table if not exists memberships (
  league_id uuid not null references leagues (id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  joined_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (league_id, user_id)
);

-- daily_seeds: one random seed per league per local date. The seed is issued
-- (via today_puzzle() below) only for the CURRENT local date, so everyone gets
-- the same board while future puzzles cannot be pre-computed. The board itself
-- is generated client-side from this seed by the pure generateBoard().
create table if not exists daily_seeds (
  league_id uuid not null references leagues (id) on delete cascade,
  puzzle_date date not null,                     -- league-local date
  seed bigint not null,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (league_id, puzzle_date)
);

-- game_records: the append-only telemetry event log, posted to the server.
-- Same shape as slice 1's localStorage records; `context` still separates
-- league from practice. Derived stats are computed on read (deriveStats), never
-- stored, so they cannot drift from the log.
create table if not exists game_records (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  context text not null check (context in ('league', 'practice')),
  league_id uuid references leagues (id) on delete set null,
  puzzle_date date,                              -- league-local date, for league games
  mode text not null check (mode in ('A', 'B', 'C')),
  total_sets int not null,
  started_at timestamptz not null,
  submitted_at timestamptz not null default now(),

-- played" gate that decides when a day's set cards become safe to show.
--
-- Returns bare user ids for a league the caller already belongs to, and
-- nothing else -- members can already read each other's display names and
-- game records, so this leaks nothing new. Zero rows for a league you are not
-- in, rather than an error.
